        <h3>Get Inspired: Watch Barefoot Contessa</h3>
        <p>One of my biggest inspirations in the kitchen is <em>Barefoot Contessa</em> (Ina Garten). Ina has always been a true inspiration to me. I vividly remember spending summers with my grandma, watching her cook on the Food Network Channel. Her warm personality and delicious recipes left a lasting impression on me.</p>

        <p><em>Here’s a video of her famous Skillet Roasted Lemon Chicken; one of my all-time favorite recipes. She created a deliciously simple yet flavorful dish with her Skillet Roasted Lemon Chicken. In this recipe, she expertly seasons bone-in, skin-on chicken with fresh lemon, garlic, and herbs, then sears it in a hot skillet to achieve crispy, golden skin. The chicken is then roasted in the oven with a squeeze of lemon and a drizzle of olive oil, resulting in juicy, tender meat with a bright, zesty flavor. This easy, one-pan dish is a perfect example of Ina’s ability to elevate simple ingredients into a stunning, comforting meal.</em></p>
