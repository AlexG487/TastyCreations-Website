    <!-- Recipe 1: Yellow Rice with Chicken and Veggies -->
    <h1>Yellow Rice with Chicken and Veggies</h1>
    <img src="IMG_2761.jpg" alt="Yellow Rice with Chicken and Veggies" style="width: 10%; margin-top: 20px;">
    <p>This recipe was inspired by a friend who reminded me how fun and easy cooking can be. Life got busy, but it's always nice to get back in the kitchen!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup jasmine rice (rinsed well)</li>
        <li>1 chicken bouillon cube</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>Frozen onion, red and green bell peppers mix (about 1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen green beans, seasoned with salt and steamed</li>
        <li>4 boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>garlic powder</li>
        <li>onion powder</li>
        <li>paprika and I used a <i>Kickin' Chicken seasoning</i></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rinse the rice well and cook it with the bouillon cube and turmeric in 2 cups of water (use chicken broth for extra flavor)</li>
        <li>Season and cook the boneless chicken thighs in a skillet over medium heat until golden and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Sauté frozen onion and bell peppers in the same skillet until soft.</li>
        <li>Steam the green beans if they’re frozen or sauté them if fresh and sprinkle salt as they cook</li>
        <li>Once everything is cooked, serve the rice with chicken and veggies on top!</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>My Cooking Comeback:</h2>
        <p>This meal reminded me how much I love cooking and how quickly I can get back into the rhythm of it, especially when I have the right ingredients and tools at my disposal. I had forgotten just how exciting cooking can be, as life got busy with work, deadlines, and other distractions. It became too easy to grab something quick or order in instead of cooking at home. But a good friend of mine reminded me of the joy that comes from being in the kitchen. We were talking about how cooking can be an escape from the chaos of daily life, and how you don’t need to be an expert to enjoy it.</p>
        <p>Inspired by that conversation, I decided to get back into the swing of things—and I’m so glad I did! This meal came together in less than 30 minutes. And what I realized is that cooking doesn’t have to take forever. With some prepped ingredients, like frozen veggies and a pack of chicken thighs, plus a little creativity in the seasoning department, you can make something flavorful and comforting without much effort.</p>
        <p>Finding that Kickin' Chicken seasoning at TJ Maxx was a game-changer for me. It reminded me not to be afraid to experiment and try new things. The right seasoning can completely transform a dish and make cooking feel fresh and exciting again.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, cooking can be quick, fun, and creative, even when you're busy. All you need is the right attitude, some inspiration (and maybe a little help from a friend), and you’ll be back in the kitchen before you know it!</p>
